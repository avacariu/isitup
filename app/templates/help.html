<h1>The help page</h1>
<p>Hopefully this will clear up some things.</p>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p><strong>isitup</strong> is a way to see which servers you've got are still running. It allows servers to call in to say that they're still running.</p>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Click <strong>New thing</strong> in the menu.</li>
  <li>Give your new thing a name</li>
  <li>The <em>Time to consider dead</em> is the timedelta from the last call to determine if the server is dead.</li>
  <li>Hit <strong>Create</strong></li>
  <li>Find your machine in the list and click the UUID</li>
  <li>Copy the <strong>Call home URL</strong> from the bottom of the page</li>
  <li>Add a cronjob that opens that URL</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>Use something like this as a cron job:<p>
<code>*/5 * * * * root curl --silent http://do.avacariu.me/isitup/api/callhome/<em>&lt;UUID&gt;</em> &gt; /dev/null</code>
